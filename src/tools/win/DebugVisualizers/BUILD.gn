# The .natvis files define "native visualizers" for the Visual Studio debugger
# that allow one to define how custom types appear.
#
# One can use them by adding them to a project in visual studio, and they can
# be embedded in a project's PDB file using the undocumented linker flag
# /NATVIS. These configs would generally be added to all_dependent_configs
# on a target so all targets that link to them will reference the visualizers
# from their PDB files.
#
# See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj620914.aspx for how they work.
#
# Since these only add ldflags, the targets themselves are not rebuilt when the
# natvis files are updated. To debug, erase the .pdb file and build to re-link.
