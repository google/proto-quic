  Inside a template invocation, this variable refers to the scope of the

  undefined.

  All of the variables defined inside the template invocation are accessible as
  members of the "invoker" scope. This is the way that templates read values
  set by the callers.

  This is often used with "defined" to see if a value is set on the invoking
  scope.

  This value should be used to indicate the desired architecture for the
  primary objects of the build. It will match the cpu architecture of the

  In many cases, this is the same as "host_cpu", but in the case of

  "target_cpu" most of the time.

  This value is not used internally by GN for any purpose, so it may be set to

  Inside a target or template invocation, this variable refers to the name
  given to the target or template invocation. Outside of these, this variable
  is undefined.

  This is most often used in template definitions to name targets defined in
  the template based on the name of the invocation. This is necessary both to
  ensure generated targets have unique names and to generate a target with the
  exact name of the invocation that other targets can depend on.

  Be aware that this value will always reflect the innermost scope. So when
  defining a target inside a template, target_name will refer to the target
  rather than the template invocation. To get the name of the template
  invocation in this case, you should save target_name to a temporary variable
  outside of any target definitions.

  In many cases, this is the same as "host_os", but in the case of
  cross-compiles, it may be different. This variable differs from "current_os"
  in that it can be referenced from inside any toolchain and will always return
  the initial value.

  This should be set to the most specific value possible. So, "android" or
  "chromeos" should be used instead of "linux" where applicable, even though
  Android and ChromeOS are both Linux variants. This can mean that one needs to
  write

    R"(allow_circular_includes_from: Permit includes from deps.

  A list of target labels. Must be a subset of the target's "deps". These
  targets will be permitted to include headers from the current target despite
  the dependency going in the opposite direction.

  When you use this, both targets must be included in a final binary for it to
  link. To keep linker errors from happening, it is good practice to have all
  external dependencies depend only on one of the two targets, and to set the
  visibility on the other to enforce this. Thus the targets will always be
  linked together in any output.

Details

  Normally, for a file in target A to include a file from target B, A must list
  B as a dependency. This invariant is enforced by the "gn check" command (and
  the --check flag to "gn gen" -- see "gn help check").

  Sometimes, two targets might be the same unit for linking purposes (two
  source sets or static libraries that would always be linked together in a
  final executable or shared library) and they each include headers from the
  other: you want A to be able to include B's headers, and B to include A's
  headers. This is not an ideal situation but is sometimes unavoidable.

  This list, if specified, lists which of the dependencies of the current
  target can include header files from the current target. That is, if A
  depends on B, B can only include headers from A if it is in A's
  allow_circular_includes_from list. Normally includes must follow the
  direction of dependencies, this flag allows them to go in the opposite
  direction.

Danger

  In the above example, A's headers are likely to include headers from A's
  dependencies. Those dependencies may have public_configs that apply flags,
  defines, and include paths that make those headers work properly.

  With allow_circular_includes_from, B can include A's headers, and
  transitively from A's dependencies, without having the dependencies that
  would bring in the public_configs those headers need. The result may be
  errors or inconsistent builds.

  So when you use allow_circular_includes_from, make sure that any compiler
  settings, flags, and include directories are the same between both targets
  (consider putting such things in a shared config they can both reference).
  Make sure the dependencies are also the same (you might consider a group to
  collect such dependencies they both depend on).

Example

  source_set("a") {
    deps = [ ":b", ":a_b_shared_deps" ]
    allow_circular_includes_from = [ ":b" ]
    ...
  }

  source_set("b") {

  arflags in a config and set that as a public or "all dependent" config, but
  that will likely not be what you want. If you have a chain of static
  libraries dependent on each other, this can cause the flags to propagate up
  to other static libraries. Due to the nature of how arflags are typically

  A list of label patterns.

  This list is a list of patterns that must not match any of the transitive
  dependencies of the target. These include all public, private, and data
  dependencies, and cross shared library boundaries. This allows you to express
  that undesirable code isn't accidentally added to downstream dependencies in
  a way that might otherwise be difficult to notice.

  Checking does not cross executable boundaries. If a target depends on an
  executable, it's assumed that the executable is a tool that is producing part
  of the build rather than something that is linked and distributed. This
  allows assert_no_deps to express what is distributed in the final target
  rather than depend on the internal build steps (which may include
  non-distributable code).

  See "gn help label_pattern" for the format of the entries in the list. These
  patterns allow blacklisting individual targets or whole directory
  hierarchies.

  Sometimes it is desirable to enforce that many targets have no dependencies
  on a target or set of targets. One efficient way to express this is to create
  a group with the assert_no_deps rule on it, and make that group depend on all
  targets you want to apply that assertion to.

Example

  executable("doom_melon") {
    deps = [ "//foo:bar" ]
    ...
    assert_no_deps = [
      "//evil/*",  # Don't link any code from the evil directory.

  A static library normally doesn't include code from dependencies, but instead
  forwards the static libraries and source sets in its deps up the dependency
  chain until a linkable target (an executable or shared library) is reached.
  The final linkable target only links each static library once, even if it
  appears more than once in its dependency graph.

  In some cases the static library might be the final desired output. For
  example, you may be producing a static library for distribution to third
  parties. In this case, the static library should include code for all
  dependencies in one complete package. However, complete static libraries
  themselves are never linked into other complete static libraries. All
  complete static libraries are for distribution and linking them in would
  cause code duplication in this case. If the static library is not for
  distribution, it should not be complete.

  GN treats non-complete static libraries as source sets when they are linked
  into complete static libraries. This is done because some tools like AR do
  not handle dependent static libraries properly. This makes it easier to write
  "alink" rules.

  In rare cases it makes sense to list a header in more than one target if it
  could be considered conceptually a member of both. libraries.

Configs on a target

  When used on a target, the include_dirs, defines, etc. in each config are
  appended in the order they appear to the compile command for each file in the
  target. They will appear after the include_dirs, defines, etc. that the
  target sets directly.

  Since configs apply after the values set on a target, directly setting a
  compiler flag will prepend it to the command line. If you want to append a
  flag instead, you can put that flag in a one-off config and append that
  config to the target's configs list.

  The build configuration script will generally set up the default configs
  applying to a given target type (see "set_defaults"). When a target is being
  defined, it can add to or remove from this list.

Configs on a config

  It is possible to create composite configs by specifying configs on a config.
  One might do this to forward values, or to factor out blocks of settings from
  very large configs into more manageable named chunks.

  In this case, the composite config is expanded to be the concatenation of its
  own values, and in order, the values from its sub-configs *before* anything
  else happens. This has some ramifications:

   - A target has no visibility into a config's sub-configs. Target code only
     sees the name of the composite config. It can't remove sub-configs or opt
     in to only parts of it. The composite config may not even be defined
     before the target is.

   - You can get duplication of values if a config is listed twice, say, on a
     target and in a sub-config that also applies. In other cases, the configs
     applying to a target are de-duped. It's expected that if a config is
     listed as a sub-config that it is only used in that context. (Note that
     it's possible to fix this and de-dupe, but it's not normally relevant and
     complicates the implementation.)

  GN doesn't require data files to exist at build-time. So actions that produce

  A depfile should be used only when a target depends on files that are not
  already specified by a target's inputs and sources. Likewise, depfiles should
  specify only those dependencies not already included in sources or inputs.

  The .d file should go in the target output directory. If you have more than

  of targets, and public_configs are always propagated across public deps of
  all types of targets.

  Inputs are compile-time dependencies of the current target. This means that
  all inputs must be available before compiling any of the sources or executing
  any actions.

  Inputs are typically only used for action and action_foreach targets.

Inputs for actions

  For action and action_foreach targets, inputs should be the inputs to script
  that don't vary. These should be all .py files that the script uses via
  imports (the main script itself will be an implicit dependency of the action
  so need not be listed).

  For action targets, inputs and sources are treated the same, but from a style
  perspective, it's recommended to follow the same rule as action_foreach and
  put helper files in the inputs, and the data used by the script (if any) in
  sources.

  Note that another way to declare input dependencies from an action is to have
  the action write a depfile (see "gn help depfile"). This allows the script to
  dynamically write input dependencies, that might not be known until actually
  executing the script. This is more efficient than doing processing while
  running GN to determine the inputs, and is easier to keep in-sync than
  hardcoding the list.

Script input gotchas

  It may be tempting to write a script that enumerates all files in a directory
  as inputs. Don't do this! Even if you specify all the files in the inputs or
  sources in the GN target (or worse, enumerate the files in an exec_script
  call when running GN, which will be slow), the dependencies will be broken.

  The problem happens if a file is ever removed because the inputs are not
  listed on the command line to the script. Because the script hasn't changed
  and all inputs are up to date, the script will not re-run and you will get a
  stale build. Instead, either list all inputs on the command line to the
  script, or if there are many, create a separate list file that the script
  reads. As long as this file is listed in the inputs, the build will detect
  when it has changed in any way and the action will re-run.

Inputs for binary targets

  Any input dependencies will be resolved before compiling any sources.
  Normally, all actions that a target depends on will be run before any files
  in a target are compiled. So if you depend on generated headers, you do not
  typically need to list them in the inputs section.

  Inputs for binary targets will be treated as implicit dependencies, meaning
  that changes in any of the inputs will force all sources in the target to be
  recompiled. If an input only applies to a subset of source files, you may
  want to split those into a separate target to avoid unnecessary recompiles.

  action("myscript") {

Types of libs

  File paths

      specified in the "libs" for linker tools. This facility should be used

      that are generated by the build, use normal GN deps to link them.

  System libraries
      Values not containing '/' will be treated as system library names. These
      will be passed unmodified to the linker and prefixed with the
      "lib_prefix" attribute of the linker tool. Generally you would set the
      "lib_dirs" so the given library is found. Your BUILD.gn file should not
      specify the switch (like "-l"): this will be encoded in the "lib_prefix"
      of the tool.

  Apple frameworks
      System libraries ending in ".framework" will be special-cased: the switch
      "-framework" will be prepended instead of the lib_prefix, and the

  Precompiled headers will be used when a target specifies this value, or a
  config applying to this target specifies this value. In addition, the tool
  corresponding to the source files must also specify precompiled headers (see
  "gn help tool"). The tool will also specify what type of precompiled headers
  to use, by setting precompiled_header_type to either "gcc" or "msvc".

  The precompiled header/source variables can be specified on a target or a
  config, but must be the same for all configs applying to a given target since
  a target can only have one precompiled header.

  If you use both C and C++ sources, the precompiled header and source file
  will be compiled once per language. You will want to make sure to wrap C++
  includes in __cplusplus #ifdefs so the file will compile in C mode.

GCC precompiled headers

  When using GCC-style precompiled headers, "precompiled_source" contains the
  path of a .h file that is precompiled and then included by all source files
  in targets that set "precompiled_source".

  The value of "precompiled_header" is not used with GCC-style precompiled
  headers.

MSVC precompiled headers

  When using MSVC-style precompiled headers, the "precompiled_header" value is
  a string corresponding to the header. This is NOT a path to a file that GN
  recognises, but rather the exact string that appears in quotes after
  an #include line in source code. The compiler will match this string against
  includes or forced includes (/FI).

  MSVC also requires a source file to compile the header with. This must be
  specified by the "precompiled_source" value. In contrast to the header value,
  this IS a GN-style file name, and tells GN which source file to compile to
  make the .pch file used for subsequent compiles.

  For example, if the toolchain specifies MSVC headers:

    toolchain("vc_x64") {
      ...
      tool("cxx") {
        precompiled_header_type = "msvc"
        ...

  You might make a config like this:

    config("use_precompiled_headers") {
      precompiled_header = "build/precompile.h"
      precompiled_source = "//build/precompile.cc"

      # Either your source files should #include "build/precompile.h"
      # first, or you can do this to force-include the header.
      cflags = [ "/FI$precompiled_header" ]
    }

  And then define a target that uses the config:

    executable("doom_melon") {
      configs += [ ":use_precompiled_headers" ]
      ...

  A list of files that other targets can include. These permissions are checked

  If no public files are declared, other targets (assuming they have visibility
  to depend on this target) can include any file in the sources list. If this
  variable is defined on a target, dependent targets may only include files on
  this whitelist.

  Header file permissions are also subject to visibility. A target must be
  visible to another target to include any files from it at all and the public
  headers indicate which subset of those files are permitted. See "gn help
  visibility" for more.

  Public files are inherited through the dependency tree. So if there is a
  dependency A -> B -> C, then A can include C's public headers. However, the
  same is NOT true of visibility, so unless A is in C's visibility list, the
  include will be rejected.

  GN only knows about files declared in the "sources" and "public" sections of
  targets. If a file is included that is not known to the build, it will be
  allowed.

Examples

  This addition happens in a second phase once a target and all of its

  force-added configs in their "configs" variable while the script is running,
  and they can not be removed. As a result, this capability should generally
  only be used to add defines and include directories necessary to compile a
  target's headers.

const char kPublicDeps_Help[] =
    R"(public_deps: Declare public dependencies.

  Public dependencies are like private dependencies (see "gn help deps") but
  additionally express that the current target exposes the listed deps as part
  of its public API.

  This has several ramifications:

    - public_configs that are part of the dependency are forwarded to direct
      dependents.

    - Public headers in the dependency are usable by dependents (includes do
      not require a direct dependency or visibility).

    - If the current target is a shared library, other shared libraries that it
      publicly depends on (directly or indirectly) are propagated up the
      dependency tree to dependents for linking.

Discussion

  Say you have three targets: A -> B -> C. C's visibility may allow B to depend
  on it but not A. Normally, this would prevent A from including any headers
  from C, and C's public_configs would apply only to B.

  If B lists C in its public_deps instead of regular deps, A will now inherit
  C's public_configs and the ability to include C's public headers.

  Generally if you are writing a target B and you include C's headers as part
  of B's public headers, or targets depending on B should consider B and C to
  be part of a unit, you should use public_deps instead of deps.

Example

  # This target can include files from "c" but not from
  # "super_secret_implementation_details".
  executable("a") {
    deps = [ ":b" ]
  }

  shared_library("b") {
    deps = [ ":super_secret_implementation_details" ]
    public_deps = [ ":c" ]
  }

  Sometimes the arguments passed to a script can be too long for the system's
  command-line capabilities. This is especially the case on Windows where the
  maximum command-line length is less than 8K. A response file allows you to
  pass an unlimited amount of data to a script in a temporary file for an
  action or action_foreach target.

  If the response_file_contents variable is defined and non-empty, the list
  will be treated as script args (including possibly substitution patterns)
  that will be written to a temporary file at build time. The name of the
  temporary file will be substituted for "{{response_file_name}}" in the script
  args.

  The response file contents will always be quoted and escaped according to
  Unix shell rules. To parse the response file, the Python script should use
  "shlex.split(file_contents)".

Example

  action("process_lots_of_files") {
    script = "process.py",
    inputs = [ ... huge list of files ... ]

    # Write all the inputs to a response file for the script. Also,
    # make the paths relative to the script working directory.

Sources for binary targets

  For binary targets (source sets, executables, and libraries), the known file
  types will be compiled with the associated tools. Unknown file types and
  headers will be skipped. However, you should still list all C/C+ header files
  so GN knows about the existence of those files for the purposes of include
  checking.

  As a special case, a file ending in ".def" will be treated as a Windows
  module definition file. It will be appended to the link line with a
  preceeding "/DEF:" string. There must be at most one .def file in a target
  and they do not cross dependency boundaries (so specifying a .def file in a
  static library or source set will have no effect on the executable or shared
  library they're linked into).

  If visibility is not defined, it defaults to public ("*").

  If visibility is defined, only the targets with labels that match it can
  depend on the current target. The empty list means no targets can depend on
  the current target.

  Tip: Often you will want the same visibility for all targets in a BUILD file.
  In this case you can just put the definition at the top, outside of any
  target, and the targets will inherit that scope and see the definition.

Patterns

  See "gn help label_pattern" for more details on what types of patterns are
  supported. If a toolchain is specified, only targets in that toolchain will
  be matched. If a toolchain is not specified on a pattern, targets in all
  toolchains will be matched.

Examples

  Only targets in the current buildfile ("private"):
    visibility = [ ":*" ]

  No targets (used for targets that should be leaf nodes):
    visibility = []

  Any target ("public", the default):
    visibility = [ "*" ]

  All targets in the current directory and any subdirectory:
    visibility = [ "./*" ]

  Any target in "//bar/BUILD.gn":
    visibility = [ "//bar:*" ]

  Any target in "//bar/" or any subdirectory thereof:
    visibility = [ "//bar/*" ]

  Just these specific targets:
    visibility = [ ":mything", "//foo:something_else" ]

  Any target in the current directory and any subdirectory thereof, plus
  any targets in "//bar/" and any subdirectory thereof.
    visibility = [ "./*", "//bar/*" ]
