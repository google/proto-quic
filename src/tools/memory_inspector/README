This is the working dir for the memory profiling tools unification project.
The goal of this project is to unify the wide variety of tools/scripts/hacks
we currently use for memory profiling (dmprof, Android dumpheap, memdump) into a
combined tool, with a nice and easy to use cli and web-interface.

This project is currently in a pretty early developement stage.
If you are looking for a "working" memory profiling tool, what you really want
at the moment is src/tools/deep_memory_profiler.
