GRIT (Google Resource and Internationalization Tool) is a tool for Windows
projects to manage resources and simplify the localization workflow.

This code previously used to live at
https://code.google.com/p/grit-i18n/source/checkout which still contains the
project's history.  https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/grit-i18n/ is
a git mirror of the SVN repository that's identical except for the last two
commits.
