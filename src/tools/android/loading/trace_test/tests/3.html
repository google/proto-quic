  Javascript indirect image loading.

  3a.js defines fn1(), which adds an <img> tag to the body. 3a.js also
  inserts a script tag with 3b.js into head (between the scripts for
  3a and 3c). 3b.js itself creates an <img> tag which directly adds it
  to the body. Finally, 3c.js defines fn3(), which
  modifies <img id='img3'>.

  Note that as 3b.js adds a tag to the body, it is executed only after
  the body has been parsed. No, I don't know how that works either.
