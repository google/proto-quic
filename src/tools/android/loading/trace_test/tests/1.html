  Test Javascript Redirection in <head>

  In <head> we have a CSS, a javascript file and a <style> tag. The javascript
  file inserts another javascript file into head, which itself inserts a <style>
  tag containing an inline font. The static <style> tag below has a font
  resource. We expect the static font resource to have an initiator with a stack
  trace incorrectly attached from the javascript.

  TODO(mattcary): It also appears that if resources are found in the cache we
  get different intiators: namely both the fonts have a parser initiator with no
  stack. This is not exactly the problem, as occasionally the initiator sequence
  changes, but can become consistent again by switching binaries with each run
  (eg, out/Debug vs out/Release).
