This is the FindBugs plugin for chrome on android.

Currently it detects:
- synchronized method
- synchronized 'this'

We don't want the synchronized method and synchronized 'this' to be
used, the exception is the synchronized method defined in Android
API.

The plugin jar file was prebuilt and checked in, to rebuild the
plugin, you need ant, and run below command, the new jar file will
be in lib directory.

ant install
