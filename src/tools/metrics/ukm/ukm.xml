<event name="Media.Engagement.SessionFinished">

  <owner>media-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The Media Engagement index stores the number of significant media playbacks
    per origin and the number of visits. From that we calculate a Media
    Engagement Score.

    media playbacks, the total number of visits, the calculated engagement score
    and the new number of significant media playbacks that occured this visit.

<event name="Media.WatchTime">
  <owner>dalecurtis@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Watch time is defined as the amount of elapsed media time for audio+video
    media aggregated per player instance. A minimum of 7 seconds of unmuted,
    foreground media must be watched to start watch time monitoring. Watch time
    is checked on a regular basis and reported upon one of the stop events
    mentioned below or at player destruction if none occur prior.

    Any one of paused, hidden, or muted is sufficient to stop watch time metric
    reports. Each of these has a hysteresis where if the state change is undone
    within some time, the watch time will be counted as uninterrupted.

    Power events (on/off battery power) have a similar hysteresis, but unlike
    the aforementioned properties, will not stop metric collection.

    Native controls events have a similar behavior than power events.

    Each seek event will result in a new watch time metric being started and the
    old metric finalized as accurately as possible.
