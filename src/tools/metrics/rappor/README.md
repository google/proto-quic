# Rappor (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy Preserving Ordinal Responses)

RAPPOR reports consist of randomly generated data that is biased based on data
collected from the user. Data from many users can be aggregated to learn
information about the population, but little or nothing can be concluded about
individual users from their reports.
