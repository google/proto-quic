This file is used to generate a comprehensive list of Chrome histograms along
with a detailed description for each histogram.

For best practices on writing histogram descriptions, see
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/tools/metrics/histograms/README.md
For details on how to modify this file to add your description, keep reading.

Please pretty-print and validate your edits by running the pretty_print.py
and validate_format.py scripts in the same directory as this file before
uploading your change for review.

Take a moment to page through the contents of this file. You will find
two sections:

* The histograms section describes base histograms, giving their name,
  and optionally their units or enum type, a short one-line summary,
  and optionally a more detailed description.
* The histogram_suffixes section provides a compact way of defining histograms
  by applying affixes to existing histograms. This could be done recursively
  and the max recursion depth is 5. See the example below for details on how it
  works.

Enum types of histograms are defined and described in enums.xml.

Each histogram_suffixes tag lists the histograms that it affects. The complete
list of histograms is computed by appending (or prepending - see below) the
histogram_suffixes suffix names to each of the affected histograms. For example,
define the following:

  <histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>

  <histogram_suffixes name="SuperHttpExperiment">
    <suffix name="SuperHttpEnabled"/>
    <suffix name="SuperHttpDisabled"/>
    <affected-histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>
  </histogram_suffixes>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  FileLoadLatency
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpEnabled
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpDisabled

histogram_suffixes can also be used to insert affix in the middle. Example:

  <histogram name="Prerender.Events"/>

  <histogram_suffixes name="SuperHttpExperiment" ordering="prefix">
    <suffix name="HoverStats50"/>
    <affected-histogram name="Prerender.Events"/>
  </histogram_suffixes>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  Prerender.Events
  Prerender.HoverStats50_Events

When 'ordering="prefix"' is present in the histogram_suffixes tag, the suffix
will be inserted after the first dot separator of the affected-histogram name.
Optionally, ordering can be specified as "prefix,N" where N indicates after
how many dots the suffix should be inserted (default=1). The affected-histogram
name has to have at least N dots in it.

Googlers: There are also a small number of private internal histograms found at
http://cs/file:chrome/histograms.xml - but prefer this file for new entries.

    Counts impressions of the NTP on Android. It also counts potential

    a potential impression since this view could be replaced with the NTP. For
    better comparison regular impressions are also counted. The no-tab view
    counting happens right after the user closed the last tab and the regular
    impression counting happens at construction time of the NTP (=whenever a new
    tab is opened).

    This metric measures the total time spent on encoding all the rows of an

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay

    IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay, the browser will switch to a non-idle task to
    force encoding to happen on the main thread.

    In addition, metric values from OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob API call are

<histogram name="Blink.UseCounter.CSSProperties" enum="MappedCSSProperties">
  <owner>rbyers@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or
    dynamically, from the time the page is initialised to when it is closed or
    navigated away from. Each property is counted at most once per page per
    view.
  </summary>
  <details>
    The first time a CSS property is parsed on a page, the histogram is updated
    to increment the counter.  Each histogram bucket corresponds to a CSS
    property (eg. width, border-radius). The exception is the 'Total pages
    measured' bucket - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were
    counted on.  When a page navigation occurs the page count bucket is
    incremented and tracking of the set of which properties have been seen is
    reset.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Note that CSS properties used inside of SVG images are tracked separately in

<histogram name="DNS.UnexpectedResolution">
  <owner>juliatuttle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    In some cases, such as when content arrives with embedded references to
    other servers, the prefetch system can't (or doesn't) attempt to pre-resolve
    the hostnames.  As an example, a visit to www.cnn.com will fetch content
    with references to about 12 additional hostnames, none of which are
    currently anticipated.  Such resolutions are termed &quot;Unexpected
    Resolutions,&quot; and the durations associated with those DNS resolutions
    are shown below.  Future features may attempt to learn (from prior
    experience locally, or from server provided hints), what secondary hostname
    resolutions should be done when a primary resolution (or navigation) takes
    place.  This histogram shows what the potential savings are that
    &quot;remain on the table&quot; until we employ some of these more advanced
    features.

    In some cases, such as when content arrives with embedded references to
    other servers, or when a page (such as one in SSL) preclude scanning and
    prefetching, the prefetch system can't (or doesn't) attempt to pre-resolve
    the hostnames.  As an example, a visit to www.cnn.com will fetch content
    with references to about 12 additional hostnames, none of which might be
    anticipated.  Similarly, clicking on a link in an SSL page won't be
    anticipated (since scanning in not allowed by default). Such resolutions are
    termed &quot;Unexpected Resolutions,&quot; and the durations associated with
    those navigation induced DNS resolutions are shown below.  If a referring
    URL is available for the navigation, the relationship to the referring URL
    was recorded, and future navigations to the referring hostname would have
    induced a pre-resolution of hostname that caused an entry below.  Such any
    entry may facilitate future listing in the ReferredPositiveHit histogram.

  </summary>
  <details>
    The exponentially weighted averaging formula is:

      rollingRssi = (1 - weight) * rollingRssi + weight * currentRssi;

    RSSI readings are inherently noisy, so this averaging gives a smoothed RSSI
    value to work with as a heuristic for proximity.

    If no RSSI was read, then a sentinel value of 127 will be recorded.

<histogram name="EasyUnlock.AuthProximity.TimeSinceLastZeroRssi" units="ms">

    Measures the time delta in milliseconds since the last zero RSSI value was
    read to when the user successfully unlocks or signs in using Smart Lock.
  </summary>
  <details>
    A zero RSSI value is special because both Bluetooth devices in a connection
    attempt to maintain by adjusting their transmit power levels. This time
    delta can be used as a possible heuristic to determine that the phone is
    close to the local device.

    If no RSSI was read, then an overflow value will be recorded.

<histogram name="EasyUnlock.AuthProximity.TransmitPowerDelta" units="dBm">

    transmit power of the local device when the user successfully unlocks or
    signs in using Smart Lock.
  </summary>
  <details>
    Devices connected using classic Bluetooth adjust their transmit power
    dynamically to optimize power and signal strength. The difference between
    the current transmit power and maximum transmit power can be used as a
    heurstic to determine if the phone is close to the local device.

    According to the Bluetooth specs, there are three classes of devices, with a
    maximum transmit power of 20, 4, and 0 dBm respectively.

    If no transmit power was read, then a sentinel value of 127 will be
    recorded.

    To be precise, this metric tracks the _least_ actionable _reason_ why the

    Time between touch event creation and when the resulting GestureScroll
    reaches the Impl thread. Maximum is 1000ms. On Windows, we measure from when
    the touch event reaches Chrome, whereas on other platforms we use the
    timestamp from the kernel. On Windows, this metric is only reported when
    |IsHighResolution| is true, which will introduce some sampling bias. This
    supersedes the Event.Latency.RendererImpl.GestureScroll metric.

<histogram name="Media.Audio.Render.BrowserCallbackRegularity">

  <summary>
    Reflects how regularly browser issues audio requests to renderer. Depends on
    how well the system buffer size the browser side renders audio at and the
    buffer size it requests from renderer are aligned.  When zero, it means
    renderer buffer size is a multiple of system buffer size, and render calls
    from browser to renderer are issued evenly. When -1, it means the renderer
    buffer size is larger than system buffer size, but is not an exact multiple
    of it; in this case browser periodically skips a call to renderer. When
    positive, floor(value/2) reflects the number of extra consecutive render
    requests issued by browser to renderer each time to fulfill the system audio
    render request; if (value/2) is not integer, then plus one more extra call
    is issued periodically.   The metric is recorded on the edge between browser

    Watch time is defined as the amount of elapsed media time for audio+video
    media aggregated per player instance. A minimum of 7 seconds of unmuted,
    foreground media must be watched to start watch time monitoring. Watch time
    is checked on a regular basis and reported to UMA upon one of the stop
    events mentioned below or at player destruction if none occur prior.

    Any one of paused, hidden, or muted is sufficient to stop watch time metric
    reports. Each of these has a hysteresis where if the state change is undone
    within some time, the watch time will be counted as uninterrupted.

    Power events (on/off battery power) have a similar hysteresis, but unlike
    the aforementioned properties, will not stop metric collection.

    Each seek event will result in a new watch time metric being started and the
    old metric finalized as accurately as possible.

  <summary>
    The number of glyph pages present in the renderer when it commits a load.
    Since this is per-sub-process, you can get the average number of glyph pages
    in the system by multiplying this number with the average number of
    renderers. Note that this typically won't count the glyph pages added as a
    result of the load that just committed, since layout will happen after the
    commit. There are 512 bytes per glyph page, but this number also very
    closely approximates the number of glyph width map pages in the same
    renderer. The only difference is that if you have font fallback, it will
    make a new glyph page and no width page, but in most common cases there is
    no fallback). Width pages are 1K each (256 floats), so you could think of
    this value as being the number of &quot;1.5K units related to glyphs per
    renderer per page load&quot;.

  <summary>
    Proxy Auto Config (PAC) allows specifying an arbitrary javascript program to
    pick network proxies on a per-request basis (based on the URL). This works
    by calling the script's FindProxyForURL() function with the target URL as
    its first argument.

    Traditionally, the URL parameter passed into the script contains the exact
    URL being loaded, except maybe for having stripped the fragment and embedded
    identity portions of the URL.

    This histogram records what happens when the URL passed into
    FindProxyForURL() additionally has had its path component stripped. Does it
    return the same proxy list as when calling FindProxyForURL() with the
    original (unmodified) URL?

    This comparison is done only when the URL scheme implies a secure channel
    (i.e. https:// and wss://), in order to gather data for crbug.com/593759.

    Currently, the most common (only?) motivations are SELF_REFERAL,

    second connection was available for a resource that either was never before
    seen, or has historically had no subresources.  The LEARNED_REFERAL
    indicates that we &quot;learned&quot; that a subresource was commonly
    needed, and that motivated the TCP/IP preconnect. The OMNIBOX motivation
    happens when a search is being suggested, and we preconnect to the search
    provider. (WARNING: Prior to version 7.517.*, enums 7, 8, and 9 may be

    number of times a queue-status check found that the queues were stopped. To
    determine that number, use the count of

<histogram name="Omnibox.CharTypedToRepaintLatency" units="ms">

    Records the time taken between a keystroke being typed in the omnibox and

    logs the time since the earliest one.

    This duration is composed of three parts: a) the time spent processing the
    initial input event, b) the time spent for the repaint task to be scheduled
    on the message loop and c) the time spent painting the Omnibox.

    To diagnose a regression, check the following breakdown metrics:
    Omnibox.QueryTime2 is a good proxy for (a) and Omnibox.PaintTime for (c).
    (b) does not have a corresponding histogram but can be analyzed on the UMA

    exact.  If Chrome did not observe the modification, then it's a conservative
    estimate: the last time Chrome observed a clipboard modification, which is
    certainly older than the current clipboard.  If Chrome never observed a
    clipboard modification, no clipboard suggestion is shown, meaning this
    histogram will never be emitted to.)

    Recorded every time the omnibox is focussed and a recent URL from the user's

    shown (which would appear above the clipboard URL suggestion) or was absent
    (which ought to only happen when the omnibox is empty / the user is on the
    NTP).

    On Android, the total count for this histogram can be usefully compared with
    the count of the user action FocusLocation in order to determine the rate at
    which a clipboard URL suggestion is shown in the omnibox.  To determine the
    same rate on iOS, one needs to compare this histogram's count with the sum
    of the user actions MobileFocusedOmniboxOnNtp, MobileFocusedFakeboxOnNtp,
    and MobileFocusedOmniboxNotOnNtp.

    Furthermore, on either platform, this histogram's count can be usefully
    compared with the count in the clipboard bucket of the
    Omnibox.SuggestionUsed.Provider histogram to determine the clickthrough rate
    on these suggestions.

    histogram helps us estimate how often this scenario happens.

    Note that since we don't currently correlate &quot;text cleared&quot; events
    with IME usage, this also captures many other cases where users clear the
    text; though it explicitly doesn't log deleting all the permanent text as
    the first action of an editing sequence (see comments in

  <summary>
    Whether the user has settings configured so that the current page URL can be
    sent to the suggest server to request contextual suggestions.  For example,
    this is only supported for users who have Google as their default search
    engine (unmodified version of Google), have search suggest enabled, are
    signed-in and syncing without a custom passphrase, and don't have an
    incognito window open.  There are other criteria too.  Recorded on focus in
    the omnibox if there is default search provider and we've constructed a
    suggest URL.

    Some additional guidelines: if an incognito window is open, all focus events
    will go into the &quot;generally ineligible&quot; bucket. Likewise, if the
    current page is a search results page, we don't allow contextual suggestions
    either so focus events on those pages go in the &quot;generally
    ineligible&quot; bucket.  The difference between &quot;eligible&quot; and
    &quot;generally eligible but not this time&quot; depends only the properties
    of the current URL.

    Recorded regardless of whether contextual or non-contextual zero suggest is
    currently enabled on the user's platform.  However, if zero suggest (in all
    forms) is entirely disabled, the user will be perpetually ineligible.

  <summary>
    Whether the user has settings configured so that the current page URL could
    be sent to the suggest server to request contextual suggestions.  For
    example, this is only supported for users who have Google as their default
    search engine (unmodified version of Google), have search suggest enabled,
    and are signed-in and syncing without a custom passphrase.  There are other
    criteria too.  Recorded on profile open.  Note that opening an incognito
    window (if none are currently open under the given profile) counts as
    opening a new profile.

    Some additional guidelines: unlike Omnibox.ZeroSuggest.Eligible.OnFocus,
    because this is recorded on profile open, users cannot be declared
    ineligible because they have an incognito window open (it's impossible to
    have an incognito window open for a given profile at the time of profile
    open) and also cannot be declared ineligible because the user is viewing a
    search results page.  (We test this on-profile-open using an arbitrary URL.)

    Recorded regardless of whether contextual or non-contextual zero suggest is
    currently enabled on the user's platform.  However, if zero suggest (in all
    forms) is entirely disabled, the user will be perpetually ineligible.

    Note this is probably not the metric you want - it does not correspond to

  <summary>
    Retries needed to enable a FET on tps65090 (AKA tpschrome).  Tps65090 is a
    power management unit (PMU) used on many ARM Chromebooks.  Until version ES7
    was rolled into production we would sometimes run into a problem where FET1
    (the FET used to switch on and off the backlight) wouldn't turn on properly.
    This problem was especially prevalent when the voltage was high (like when
    the device was plugged into the wall).  Retrying by turning the FET off and
    on again is nearly always effective, so the kernel will retry up to 5 times
    (currently) and will also log the fact that it needed to retry.  On newest
    kernels (kernel 3.8 and up) a kernel warning will be logged with WARN_ON if
    the FET still failed to turn on after 5 tries. Refer to the kernel warning
    reports to find that information.  For more details about this bug refer to
    http://crbug.com/338657 and http://crosbug.com/p/16009.  Note that we log
    retries on all 7 FETs even though we've only ever seen failures of FET1.

<histogram name="ServiceWorker.ActivatedWorkerPreparationForMainFrame.Time"
    units="ms">
  <owner>horo@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The time taken for the browser to find and possibly start an active worker
    to dispatch a FetchEvent for a main frame resource request. For context, a
    FetchEvent can only be dispatched to an ACTIVATED worker that is running (it
    has been successfully started). The measurements starts when the browser
    process receives the request. The browser then finds the worker appropriate
    for this request (if there is none, this metric is not recorded). If that
    worker is already started, the browser process can send the request to it,
    so the measurement ends quickly. Otherwise the browser process has to start
    the worker and the measurement ends when the worker is successfully started
    (we do not include in the time it takes for the worker to become ACTIVATED).
    The metric is not recorded in the following situations: 1) The worker was in
    state INSTALLED or ACTIVATING, and the browser had to wait for it to become
    ACTIVATED. This is to avoid including the time to execute the activate event
    handlers in the worker's script. 2) The worker was started for the fetch AND
    DevTools was attached during startup. This is intended to avoid including
    the time for debugging. 3) The request is for New Tab Page. This is because
    it tends to dominate the stats and makes the results largely skewed.

    This metric logs CLD3-detected languages for pages that specify a

    Bucket names are of the form &quot;x,y&quot;, where x is the common English
    language code specified in the page markup (or &quot;other&quot; if the
    English language code is uncommon), and y is the CLD3-detected language.

    mismatching the HTML language, CLD can complement the HTML language. For
    example, suppose the HTML language is 'zh' (general Chinese), a language
    code that the Translate server does not support.  In this case, CLD can
    detect a subcode like '-TW' or '-CN', resulting in language codes 'zh-TW'

    NOTE: As of M57 this has been superseded by Blink.UseCounter.Features which

    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or
    dynamically, from the time the page is initialised to when it is closed or
    navigated away from. Each property is counted at most once per page per
    view.
  </summary>
  <details>
    Every time a CSS property is parsed on a page, that property is recorded as
    having been used. The histogram is updated with this data whenever a page is
    closed, or a page navigation happens. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a
    CSS property (eg width, border-radius). The exception is the bucket numbered
    '1' - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were counted on.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Internally, each WebCore::Page has a WebCore::UseCounter instance, with
    booleans recording use of each CSS property - one boolean per property. Upon
    destruction of the WebCore::Page (e.g. by the user closing the tab), or a
    page navigation happening, the histogram is updated. For each boolean that
    is set to True, the corresponding histogram bucket for that CSS property is
    incremented by 1. The page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) is always
    incremented by 1 on each histogram update.

    usable. A new value is logged every 10 seconds and the logged value is the
    assessment of whether the filter is usable at the time when the value is
    logged.

    This metric is recorded when folder JumpListIcons is moved (can be rename or
    copy and delete) to JumpListIconsOld. This happens when tabs are closed,
    mostly visited URLs get updated, etc. There are several key steps in this
    folder move operation. Before the move operation, there is another step that
    JumpListIconsOld folder is deleted. The status of these steps are put
    together and recorded in this metric. The failure of any of these steps is
    suspected to be related to a known issue.

    JumpListIcons is moved, 3) if any of the previous steps fails, JumpListIcons
    is deleted, 4) A new JumpListIcons folder is created. The status of these 4
