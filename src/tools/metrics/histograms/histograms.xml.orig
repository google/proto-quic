This file is used to generate a comprehensive list of Chrome histograms along
with a detailed description for each histogram.

Please pretty-print and validate your edits by running the pretty_print.py
and validate_format.py scripts in the same directory as this file before
uploading your change for review.

Take a moment to page through the contents of this file. You will find
three sections:

* The histograms section describes base histograms, giving their name,
  and optionally their units or enum type, a short one-line summary,
  and optionally a more detailed description.
* The enums section defines and documents the enumerated types referred to by
  the histograms.
* The histogram_suffixes section provides a compact way of defining histograms
  by applying affixes to existing histograms. This could be done recursively
  and the max recursion depth is 5. See the example below for details on how it
  works.

Each histogram_suffixes tag lists the histograms that it affects. The complete
list of histograms is computed by appending (or prepending - see below) the
histogram_suffixes suffix names to each of the affected histograms. For example,
define the following:

  <histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>

  <histogram_suffixes name="SuperHttpExperiment">
    <suffix name="SuperHttpEnabled"/>
    <suffix name="SuperHttpDisabled"/>
    <affected-histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>
  </histogram_suffixes>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  FileLoadLatency
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpEnabled
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpDisabled

histogram_suffixes can also be used to insert affix in the middle. Example:

  <histogram name="Prerender.Events"/>

  <histogram_suffixes name="SuperHttpExperiment" ordering="prefix">
    <suffix name="HoverStats50"/>
    <affected-histogram name="Prerender.Events"/>
  </histogram_suffixes>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  Prerender.Events
  Prerender.HoverStats50_Events

When 'ordering="prefix"' is present in the histogram_suffixes tag, the suffix
will be inserted after the first dot separator of the affected-histogram name.
Therefore, the affected-histogram name has to have at least one dot in it.

Googlers: There are also a small number of private internal histograms found at
http://cs/file:chrome/histograms.xml - but prefer this file for new entries.

  <summary>HTTP latency seen by the Connectivity Diagnostics.</summary>
  <details>
    HTTP latency is computed using the chrome.socket API to make an HTTP GET
    request to the /generate_204 page of three randomly generated Google
    hostnames (*-ccd-testing-v4.metric.gstatic.com). The time taken from issuing
    the HTTP request to receiving a response is clocked in JavaScript and the
    arithmetic mean of the three times is used as the HTTP latency.

  <details>
    Resolver latency is computed by using the chrome.dns API to query three
    randomly generated Google hostnames (*-ccd-testing-v4.metric.gstatic.com).
    The random hostnames guarantees that there will be no caching of DNS
    hostnames. The time taken from issuing the DNS request to receiving a
    response is clocked in JavaScript and the arithmetic mean of the three times
    is used as the resolver latency.

  <summary>
    The duration of time saved due to DNS pre-resolving in the &quot;name was
    found&quot; case, and induced by predicting (using referrer lists) that a
    resolution was needed. Time &quot;savings&quot; shown in the histogram are
    defined to be the difference between the DNS pre-resolution duration, and
    the DNS resolution duration seen during a navigation.  These cache hits only
    list events where the DNS pre-resolve duration for a host was in excess of
    15ms (i.e., the network was consulted), and the actual DNS resolution (when
    a user attempted to navigate to a link with the same host name) took less
    than 15ms (i.e., the network was not consulted), which means the gain was a
    result of a &quot;cache hit&quot; in the OS cache.

    The duration of time used by the DNS pre-resolving threads to resolve a host
    name via the network.  Any resolutions that are faster than 15ms are
    considered to be local cache hits, not requiring network access, and are not
    included in this histogram. This histogram is most useful for estimating the
    typical cost of a name resolution, but it also estimates the total number of
    network-based resolutions induced by this feature.  Not all these
    resolutions prove helpful (i.e., the user does not always actually visit the
    resolved hostnames).

  <summary>
    In some cases, such as when content arrives with embedded references to
    other servers, the prefetch system can't (or doesn't) attempt to pre-resolve
    the hostnames.  As an example, a visit to www.cnn.com will fetch content
    with references to about 12 additional hostnames, none of which are
    currently anticipated.  Such resolutions are termed &quot;Unexpected
    Resolutions,&quot; and the durations associated with those DNS resolutions
    are shown below.  Future features may attempt to learn (from prior
    experience locally, or from server provided hints), what secondary hostname
    resolutions should be done when a primary resolution (or navigation) takes
    place.  This histogram shows what the potential savings are that
    &quot;remain on the table&quot; until we employ some of these more advanced
    features.

    In some cases, such as when content arrives with embedded references to
    other servers, or when a page (such as one in SSL) preclude scanning and
    prefetching, the prefetch system can't (or doesn't) attempt to pre-resolve
    the hostnames.  As an example, a visit to www.cnn.com will fetch content
    with references to about 12 additional hostnames, none of which might be
    anticipated.  Similarly, clicking on a link in an SSL page won't be
    anticipated (since scanning in not allowed by default). Such resolutions are
    termed &quot;Unexpected Resolutions,&quot; and the durations associated with
    those navigation induced DNS resolutions are shown below.  If a referring
    URL is available for the navigation, the relationship to the referring URL
    was recorded, and future navigations to the referring hostname would have
    induced a pre-resolution of hostname that caused an entry below.  Such any
    entry may facilitate future listing in the ReferredPositiveHit histogram.

<histogram name="EasyUnlock.AuthProximity.RollingRssi" units="dBm">

  <summary>
    Measures the exponentially weighted rolling average of the received signal
    strength indicator (RSSI) of the phone when the user successfully unlocks or
    signs in using Smart Lock.
  </summary>
  <details>
    The exponentially weighted averaging formula is:

      rollingRssi = (1 - weight) * rollingRssi + weight * currentRssi;

    RSSI readings are inherently noisy, so this averaging gives a smoothed RSSI
    value to work with as a heuristic for proximity.

    If no RSSI was read, then a sentinel value of 127 will be recorded.

</histogram>

<histogram name="EasyUnlock.AuthProximity.TimeSinceLastZeroRssi" units="ms">

  <summary>
    Measures the time delta in milliseconds since the last zero RSSI value was
    read to when the user successfully unlocks or signs in using Smart Lock.
  </summary>
  <details>
    A zero RSSI value is special because both Bluetooth devices in a connection
    attempt to maintain by adjusting their transmit power levels. This time
    delta can be used as a possible heuristic to determine that the phone is
    close to the local device.

    If no RSSI was read, then an overflow value will be recorded.

<histogram name="EasyUnlock.AuthProximity.TransmitPowerDelta" units="dBm">

  <summary>
    Measures the difference between the current transmit power and the maximum
    transmit power of the local device when the user successfully unlocks or
    signs in using Smart Lock.
  </summary>
  <details>
    Devices connected using classic Bluetooth adjust their transmit power
    dynamically to optimize power and signal strength. The difference between
    the current transmit power and maximum transmit power can be used as a
    heurstic to determine if the phone is close to the local device.

    According to the Bluetooth specs, there are three classes of devices, with a
    maximum transmit power of 20, 4, and 0 dBm respectively.

    If no transmit power was read, then a sentinel value of 127 will be
    recorded.

  <details>
    Statistics about what Bluetooth capabilities are available will determine
    how the EasyUnlock feature gets developed and deployed across platforms.

    This value is logged only once during the lifetime of the Chrome process,
    shortly after it starts up.  If a Bluetooth USB adapter is inserted after
    that point, the change will not be registered until Chrome restarts.

  </summary>
  <details>
    To be precise, this metric tracks the _least_ actionable _reason_ why the
    _most_ actionable _device_ is not eligible as an unlock key. For example,
    suppose that the user has 10 ineligible devices returned. This metric tries

    typically hosted in CRX files). This should be 0 for unstable channels like
    canary and dev, because we try *not* to suppress errors and instead kill the
    renderer and generate a crash report. However, at times we need to suppress
    even those. Note that this histogram is intended to be tracked over time,
    per channel, to observe crash rates. Comparisons between
    stable/beta/dev/canary are unlikely to be meaningful.

  <summary>
    The number of glyph pages present in the renderer when it commits a load.
    Since this is per-sub-process, you can get the average number of glyph pages
    in the system by multiplying this number with the average number of
    renderers. Note that this typically won't count the glyph pages added as a
    result of the load that just committed, since layout will happen after the
    commit. There are 512 bytes per glyph page, but this number also very
    closely approximates the number of glyph width map pages in the same
    renderer. The only difference is that if you have font fallback, it will
    make a new glyph page and no width page, but in most common cases there is
    no fallback). Width pages are 1K each (256 floats), so you could think of
    this value as being the number of &quot;1.5K units related to glyphs per
    renderer per page load&quot;.

    When a preconnection is made, indicate what the motivation was.
  </summary>
  <details>
    Currently, the most common (only?) motivations are SELF_REFERAL,
    LEARNED_REFERAL and OMNIBOX. The SELF_REFERAL indicates that we made sure a
    second connection was available for a resource that either was never before
    seen, or has historically had no subresources.  The LEARNED_REFERAL
    indicates that we &quot;learned&quot; that a subresource was commonly
    needed, and that motivated the TCP/IP preconnect. The OMNIBOX motivation
    happens when a search is being suggested, and we preconnect to the search
    provider. (WARNING: Prior to version 7.517.*, enums 7, 8, and 9 may be
    confused, as EARLY_LOAD_MOTIVATED was inserted new 6 value.)

    This histogram summarizes information about a 21 packet sequence, indicating
    for each of the 21 possible prefixes of this pattern, how many packets were
    received in that prefix.  The first range uses buckets 0 and 1, and it
    describes the 1st packet in the sequence.  It indicates if the first packet
    was missing (bucket 0), or the first packet was present (bucket 1).  The
    second range uses buckets 2 through 4, and describes the first 2 packets in
    the prefix of this sequence.  It indicates if there were no packets received
    in the first two packets (bucket 2), or there was one out of two packets
    received (bucket 3), or if there was two out of tow received (bucket 4).

    Counts the number of times that the user text is cleared.  IME users are
    sometimes in the situation that IME was unintentionally turned on and failed
    to input latin alphabets (ASCII characters) or the opposite case.  In that
    case, users may delete all the text and the user text gets cleared.  This
    histogram helps us estimate how often this scenario happens.

    Note that since we don't currently correlate &quot;text cleared&quot; events
    with IME usage, this also captures many other cases where users clear the
    text; though it explicitly doesn't log deleting all the permanent text as
    the first action of an editing sequence (see comments in

  <owner>Please list the metric's owners. Add more owner tags as needed.</owner>
  <summary>
    Retries needed to enable a FET on tps65090 (AKA tpschrome).  Tps65090 is a
    power management unit (PMU) used on many ARM Chromebooks.  Until version ES7
    was rolled into production we would sometimes run into a problem where FET1
    (the FET used to switch on and off the backlight) wouldn't turn on properly.
    This problem was especially prevalent when the voltage was high (like when
    the device was plugged into the wall).  Retrying by turning the FET off and
    on again is nearly always effective, so the kernel will retry up to 5 times
    (currently) and will also log the fact that it needed to retry.  On newest
    kernels (kernel 3.8 and up) a kernel warning will be logged with WARN_ON if
    the FET still failed to turn on after 5 tries. Refer to the kernel warning
    reports to find that information.  For more details about this bug refer to
    http://crbug.com/338657 and http://crosbug.com/p/16009.  Note that we log
    retries on all 7 FETs even though we've only ever seen failures of FET1.

    before being killed. For first launch after upgrade, the crash reports may

    Page load time (PLT) for iOS that does not include time spent following

    following redirects. This metric represents the time between when navigation
    is initiated (prior to DNS, TCP connect, etc but after following redirects)
    until loading ends (i.e. JS onload event). On non-iOS Chrome this is
    (performance.timing.loadEventEnd - performance.timing.redirectEnd). On

<histogram name="WebCore.FeatureObserver.CSSProperties"

    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or
    dynamically, from the time the page is initialised to when it is closed or
    navigated away from. Each property is counted at most once per page per
    view.
  </summary>
  <details>
    Every time a CSS property is parsed on a page, that property is recorded as
    having been used. The histogram is updated with this data whenever a page is
    closed, or a page navigation happens. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a
    CSS property (eg width, border-radius). The exception is the bucket numbered
    '1' - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were counted on.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Internally, each WebCore::Page has a WebCore::UseCounter instance, with
    booleans recording use of each CSS property - one boolean per property. Upon
    destruction of the WebCore::Page (e.g. by the user closing the tab), or a
    page navigation happening, the histogram is updated. For each boolean that
    is set to True, the corresponding histogram bucket for that CSS property is
    incremented by 1. The page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) is always
    incremented by 1 on each histogram update.

    The AEC in WebRTC keeps a buffer to mimic the audio buffers in the lower
    layers. This histogram logs a sudden positive jump in buffer size. Since we
    detect jumps in the capture thread, only positive values are feasible. Note

    Deprecated as of 8/2013. This histogram only considered the leaf certificate
    expiry date as a proxy for whether a certificate was in-scope for the BRs,
    but did not consider the issuance date. As some CAs have issued long-lived
    certs prior to the BRs, this disproportionately reported those certs as
    being subject to the BRs, but non-compliant, when in reality they're not
    subject.
