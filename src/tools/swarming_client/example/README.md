# Swarming examples

This directory contains examples how to use this toolset to run tasks remotely.

You should look at the code and try these in the following order:

*   1_isolate_server.py
*   2_swarming_run.py
*   3_swarming_trigger_collect.py
*   4_swarming_run_manual_upload.py

Look at the docstring of each script to see what they do.
