- patches/channel_id.patch: add basic ChannelID support. (Signatures are not
  checked.)
- patches/signed_certificate_timestamps.patch: add support for sending Signed
  Certificate Timestamps over a TLS extension.
- patches/fallback_scsv.patch: add support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. See

  failures.
- patches/intolerance_options.patch: Add an option to further control
  simulated TLS version intolerance.

  so tests can query it.
- patches/certificate_request.patch: Fix client auth for TLS 1.2.
- patches/aes_gcm.patch: Implement AES-GCM and never select TLS 1.2 ciphers
  unless >= TLS 1.2 is negotiated.

  for disabling channel id.
- patches/exported_keying_material.patch: Add method to Session to get
  exported keying material (RFC 5705) for use in e.g. Token Binding.
- patches/token_binding_resumption.patch: Fix token binding negotiation
  extension to work on session resumption.
- patches/extension_number_update.patch: Update TLS extension numbers.
- patches/save_randoms.patch: Save client and server randoms when resuming
  sessions.
