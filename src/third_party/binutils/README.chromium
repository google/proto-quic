Description:
This directory contains i386 and amd64 binaries of the binutils tools
(including gold linker).

They were built from binutils-2.25 using the "build-all.sh" script on a Ubuntu
Precise.

The script creates chroots for 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu Precise and then builds
binutils inside the roots. It also builds tcmalloc and links binutils with it
to improve the speed of LTO.

Version 2.25 was released on Wed, 24 Dec 2014
