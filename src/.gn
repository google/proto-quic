# These are the list of GN files that run exec_script. This whitelist exists
# to force additional review for new uses of exec_script, which is strongly
# discouraged.
#
# GYPI_TO_GN
#
# Most of these entries are for gypi_to_gn calls. We should not be adding new
# calls to this script in the build (see //build/gypi_to_gn.py for detailed
# advice). The only time you should be editing this list for gypi_to_gn
# purposes is when moving an existing call to a different place.
#
# PLEASE READ
#
# You should almost never need to add new exec_script calls. exec_script is
# slow, especially on Windows, and can cause confusing effects. Although
# individually each call isn't slow or necessarily very confusing, at the scale
# of our repo things get out of hand quickly. By strongly pushing back on all
# additions, we keep the build fast and clean. If you think you need to add a
# new call, please consider:
#
# - Do not use a script to check for the existance of a file or directory to
#   enable a different mode. Instead, use GN build args to enable or disable
#   functionality and set options. An example is checking for a file in the
#   src-internal repo to see if the corresponding src-internal feature should
#   be enabled. There are several things that can go wrong with this:
#
#    - It's mysterious what causes some things to happen. Although in many cases
#      such behavior can be conveniently automatic, GN optimizes for explicit
#      and obvious behavior so people can more easily diagnose problems.
#
#    - The user can't enable a mode for one build and not another. With GN build
#      args, the user can choose the exact configuration of multiple builds
#      using one checkout. But implicitly basing flags on the state of the
#      checkout, this functionality is broken.
#
#    - It's easy to get stale files. If for example the user edits the gclient
#      to stop checking out src-internal (or any other optional thing), it's
#      easy to end up with stale files still mysteriously triggering build
#      conditions that are no longer appropriate (yes, this happens in real
#      life).
#
# - Do not use a script to iterate files in a directory (glob):
#
#    - This has the same "stale file" problem as the above discussion. Various
#      operations can leave untracked files in the source tree which can cause
#      surprising effects.
#
#    - It becomes impossible to use "git grep" to find where a certain file is
#      referenced. This operation is very common and people really do get
#      confused when things aren't listed.
#
#    - It's easy to screw up. One common case is a build-time script that packs
#      up a directory. The author notices that the script isn't re-run when the
#      directory is updated, so adds a glob so all the files are listed as
#      inputs. This seems to work great... until a file is deleted. When a
#      file is deleted, all the inputs the glob lists will still be up to date
#      and no command-lines will have been changed. The action will not be
#      re-run and the build will be broken. It is possible to get this correct
#      using glob, and it's possible to mess it up without glob, but globs make
#      this situation much easier to create. if the build always lists the
#      files and passes them to a script, it will always be correct.
