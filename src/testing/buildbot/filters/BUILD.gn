# This BUILD.gn file groups together filter files for particular test suites -
# for example filters applicable to content_browsertests are exposed as
# the //testing/buildbot/filters:content_browsertests target.

# Note that all filter files (for a given test suite) are unconditionally listed
# together, even if some filter files are applicable only to some platforms.
# This should help avoid unpleasant surprises when a bot config is switched in
# testing/buildbot/chromium.fyi.json without corresponding dependency changes
# here - see https://crbug.com/661447.

# To refresh, a command similar to the one below might be run in bash:
# $ for i in $(ls -1 testing/buildbot/filters/*.browser_tests.*filter ); \
#   do echo "    \"//$i\","; done | sort
