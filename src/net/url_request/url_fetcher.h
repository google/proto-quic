// To use this class, create an instance with the desired URL and a pointer to
// the object to be notified when the URL has been loaded:
//   std::unique_ptr<URLFetcher> fetcher =
//       URLFetcher::Create(GURL("http://www.google.com"),
//                          URLFetcher::GET,
//                          this);
//
// You must also set a request context getter:
//
//   fetcher->SetRequestContext(&my_request_context_getter);
//
// Then, optionally set properties on this object, like the request context or
// extra headers:
//   fetcher->AddExtraRequestHeader("X-Foo: bar");
//
// Finally, start the request:
//   fetcher->Start();
//
// You may cancel the request by destroying the URLFetcher:
//   fetcher.reset();
//
// The object you supply as a delegate must inherit from URLFetcherDelegate.
// When the fetch is completed, OnURLFetchComplete() will be called with a
// pointer to the URLFetcher. From that point until the original URLFetcher
// instance is destroyed, you may use accessor methods to see the result of the
// fetch. You should copy these objects if you need them to live longer than
// the URLFetcher instance. If the URLFetcher instance is destroyed before the
// callback happens, the fetch will be canceled and no callback will occur.
//
// You may create the URLFetcher instance on any sequence; OnURLFetchComplete()
// will be called back on the same sequence you use to create the instance.
//
//
// NOTE: By default URLFetcher requests are NOT intercepted, except when
// interception is explicitly enabled in tests.
