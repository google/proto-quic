cert_net/ contains certificate functionality that depends on network loading (OCSP, CRL, AIA fetching).

Conceptually certificates (net/cert/) is a separable concept from net/ and may
end up becoming its own build target. This file organization encourages not
adding dependencies in cert/ for doing network loading. Instead that code
should be placed here.
