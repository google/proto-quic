  // 2) RequestSocket returns OK with a newly connected socket.
  // 3) RequestSocket returns ERR_IO_PENDING.  The handle will be added to a
  // wait list until a socket is available to reuse or a new socket finishes
  // connecting.  |priority| will determine the placement into the wait list.
  // 4) An error occurred early on, so RequestSocket returns an error code.
  // 5) A recoverable error occurred while setting up the socket.  An error
  // code is returned, but the |handle| is initialized with the new socket.
  // The caller must recover from the error before using the connection, or
  // Disconnect the socket before releasing or resetting the |handle|.
  // The current recoverable errors are: the errors accepted by

  // StreamSocket was reused, then ClientSocketPool will call
  // |handle|->set_reused(true).  In either case, the socket will have been
  // allocated and will be connected.  A client might want to know whether or
  // not the socket is reused in order to request a new socket if it encounters
  // an error with the reused socket.
