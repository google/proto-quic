// (unbounded mode).
//
// Bounded mode:
// The events are written to a single JSON object that is split across the
// files, and the files must be stitched together once the observation period
// is over. The first file is constants.json, followed by a consumer-specified
// number of event files named event_file_<index>.json, and the last file is
// end_netlog.json.
//
// The user is able to specify an approximate maximum cumulative size for the
// netlog files and the observer overwrites old events when the maximum file
// size is reached.
//
// Unbounded mode:
// The entire JSON object is put into one file. There is no size limit to how
// large this file can grow; all events added will be written to the file.
//
// The consumer must call StartObservingBounded/StartObservingUnbounded before
// calling StopObserving, and must call each method exactly once in the lifetime
// of the observer. StartObservingBounded/StartObservingUnbounded and
// StopObserving must be called on the same thread, but there is no restriction
