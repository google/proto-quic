// files, and the files must be stitched together once the observation period
// is over. The first file is constants.json, followed by a consumer-specified
// number of event files named event_file_<index>.json, and the last file is
// end_netlog.json.
//
// The user is able to specify an approximate maximum cumulative size for the
// netlog files and the observer overwrites old events when the maximum file
// size is reached.
//
// The consumer must call StartObserving before calling StopObserving, and must
// call each method exactly once in the lifetime of the observer. StartObserving
// and StopObserving must be called on the same thread, but there is no
// restriction on which thread is used.
