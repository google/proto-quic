// Used for reading QUIC data. Though there isn't really anything terribly
// QUIC-specific here, it's a helper class that's useful when doing QUIC
// framing.
//
// To use, simply construct a QuicDataReader using the underlying buffer that
// you'd like to read fields from, then call one of the Read*() methods to
// actually do some reading.
//
// This class keeps an internal iterator to keep track of what's already been
// read and each successive Read*() call automatically increments said iterator
// on success. On failure, internal state of the QuicDataReader should not be
// trusted and it is up to the caller to throw away the failed instance and
// handle the error as appropriate. None of the Read*() methods should ever be
// called after failure, as they will also fail immediately.
