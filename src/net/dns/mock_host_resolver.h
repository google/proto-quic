// In most cases, it is important that unit tests avoid relying on making actual
// DNS queries since the resulting tests can be flaky, especially if the network
// is unreliable for some reason.  To simplify writing tests that avoid making
// actual DNS queries, pass a MockHostResolver as the HostResolver dependency.
// The socket addresses returned can be configured using the
// RuleBasedHostResolverProc:
//
//   host_resolver->rules()->AddRule("foo.com", "1.2.3.4");
//   host_resolver->rules()->AddRule("bar.com", "2.3.4.5");
//
// The above rules define a static mapping from hostnames to IP address
// literals.  The first parameter to AddRule specifies a host pattern to match
// against, and the second parameter indicates what value should be used to
// replace the given hostname.  So, the following is also supported:
//
//   host_mapper->AddRule("*.com", "127.0.0.1");
//
// Replacement doesn't have to be string representing an IP address. It can
// re-map one hostname to another as well.
//
// By default, MockHostResolvers include a single rule that maps all hosts to
// 127.0.0.1.
