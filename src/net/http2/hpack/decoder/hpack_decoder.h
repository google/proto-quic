// Decodes HPACK blocks, calls an HpackDecoderListener with the decoded header
// entries. Also notifies the listener of errors and of the boundaries of the
// HPACK blocks.

// TODO(jamessynge): Add feature allowing an HpackEntryDecoderListener
// sub-class (and possibly others) to be passed in for counting events,
// so that deciding whether to count is not done by having lots of if
// statements, but instead by inserting an indirection only when needed.

// TODO(jamessynge): Consider whether to return false from methods below
// when an error has been previously detected. It protects calling code
// from its failure to pay attention to previous errors, but should we
// spend time to do that?
