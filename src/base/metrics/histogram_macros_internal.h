//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Histograms are often put in areas where they are called many many times, and
// performance is critical.  As a result, they are designed to have a very low
// recurring cost of executing (adding additional samples). Toward that end,
// the macros declare a static pointer to the histogram in question, and only
// take a "slow path" to construct (or find) the histogram on the first run
// through the macro. We leak the histograms at shutdown time so that we don't
// have to validate using the pointers at any time during the running of the
// process.


// In some cases (integration into 3rd party code), it's useful to separate the
// definition of |atomic_histogram_pointer| from its use. To achieve this we
// define HISTOGRAM_POINTER_USE, which uses an |atomic_histogram_pointer|, and
// STATIC_HISTOGRAM_POINTER_BLOCK, which defines an |atomic_histogram_pointer|
// and forwards to HISTOGRAM_POINTER_USE.
