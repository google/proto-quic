// Runs pending tasks in the order of the tasks' post time + delay, and keeps
// track of a mock (virtual) tick clock time that can be fast-forwarded.
//
// TestMockTimeTaskRunner has the following properties:
//
//   - Methods RunsTasksOnCurrentThread() and Post[Delayed]Task() can be called
//     from any thread, but the rest of the methods must be called on the same
//     thread the TaskRunner was created on.
//   - It allows for reentrancy, in that it handles the running of tasks that in
//     turn call back into it (e.g., to post more tasks).
//   - Tasks are stored in a priority queue, and executed in the increasing
//     order of post time + delay, but ignoring nestability.
//   - It does not check for overflow when doing time arithmetic. A sufficient
//     condition for preventing overflows is to make sure that the sum of all
//     posted task delays and fast-forward increments is still representable by
//     a TimeDelta, and that adding this delta to the starting values of Time
//     and TickTime is still within their respective range.
//   - Tasks aren't guaranteed to be destroyed immediately after they're run.
//
// This is a slightly more sophisticated version of TestSimpleTaskRunner, in
// that it supports running delayed tasks in the correct temporal order.
