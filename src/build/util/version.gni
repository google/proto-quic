# This exposes the Chrome version as GN variables for use in build files.
#
# PREFER NOT TO USE THESE. The GYP build uses this kind of thing extensively.
# However, it is far better to write an action (or use the process_version
# wrapper in chrome/version.gni) to generate a file at build-time with the
# information you need. This allows better dependency checking and GN will
# run faster.
#
# These values should only be used if you REALLY need to depend on them at
# build-time, for example, in the computation of output file names.

# Give version.py a pattern that will expand to a GN scope consisting of
# all values we need at once.
